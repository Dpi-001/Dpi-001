BarterLink is my current main focusâ€”a smart e-commerce exchange system built from the ground up. This project is my sandbox for advanced Laravel and Vue.js integration, where I'm exploring how technology can foster a more sustainable economy.

Stack: Laravel, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS

Focus: Secure APIs, streamlined exchange logic, responsive design
